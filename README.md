# Data-Visualization-and-Generalized-linear-models
This project have various perspective of analysis. The two main analytics tools used are data visualizations and logistic regression analysis
## for visualizations
The dataset behind the visualizations reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of
murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to
2018. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's Citizen Law Enforcement
Analysis and Reporting system. The data set contains mainly descriptive variables from initial
police reports of crimes in Chicago, no numerical data existed in the dataset. A count of the
number of records for the categorical variables was primarily used for quantitative visualization.
