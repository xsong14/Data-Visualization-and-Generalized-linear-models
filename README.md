# Data-Visualization-and-Generalized-linear-models
This project have various perspective of analysis. The two main analytics tools used are data visualizations and logistic regression analysis
## for visualizations
The dataset behind the visualizations reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of
murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to
2018. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's Citizen Law Enforcement
Analysis and Reporting system. The data set contains mainly descriptive variables from initial
police reports of crimes in Chicago, no numerical data existed in the dataset. A count of the
number of records for the categorical variables was primarily used for quantitative visualization.

However, the true and false variables were transformed to binary numerical values in order to
visualize the dataset. The records can be based on unverified preliminary information supplied
to the Police Department by the reporting parties. The preliminary crime classifications may be
changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility
of mechanical or human error.
I joined shape files provided by the Chicago government to map crime location data to police
districts for a more granular visualization purpose. I used both police district, and city street
shapefiles.
